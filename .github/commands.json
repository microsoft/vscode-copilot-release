Please help us out by providing a screen recording showing exactly what isn't working as expected. While we can work with most standard formats, `.gif` files are preferred as they are displayed inline on GitHub. You may find https://gifcap.dev helpful as a browser-based gif recording tool.\n\nIf the issue depends on keyboard input, you can help us by enabling screencast mode for the recording (`Developer: Toggle Screencast Mode` in the command palette).
